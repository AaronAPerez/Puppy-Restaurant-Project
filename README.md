Making a new Github to clean our collaborated codes for grading.































Reviewer - David Jimenez: <br>
* Index page looks well made over all with most of the elements matching the prototype <br>
* Index page needs footer margin / padding to bottom. <br>
* Index footer needs more spacing horizontally between the two groups of content (eg addres group needs to be spaced more away from the Spaniel Company logo group) <br>
<br>

* About page all images seem correctly proportioned and working.<br>
* First main image does not respond properly and instead squishes and does not maintain aspect ratio <br>
* Cards of image and text grid is scaling properly when window view is smaller
* Footer is not spaced far enough apart horizontally <br>
<br>

* Menu page looks well made but needs amounts correctly made with content <br>
* I like the footer with how it get smaller but logo does not maintain aspect ratio <br>
* In small screen it looks great with minor issues <br>
* with mid size screen its good but has small margin / padding issues <br>
<br>

* Catering page is working properly for all aspects and everything seems spaced properly <br>
* Only issue i see is the catering services picture does not maintain aspect ractio when squished.
* Some minor right margin / padding issues but great otherwise <br>
<br>

* Upon first view it looks correctly made but footer too much margin/ padding between photos grid and footer <br>
* Changing to lower than a mid size screen the view snaps to verticle placing of images and everything looks like it lines up <br>
* With smallest screen, the view is wonderful and looks well made  with a modified footer.  great job!
