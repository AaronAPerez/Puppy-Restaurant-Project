Create a website that looks exactly like the one provided

I learned way alot of html from google and videos, learning what more clearly what exactly the containers do, from resizing the images in styles and collum sizes from 1-12. im starting to comprehend it more i just feel like i could use way more teaching or experience in seeing how everything works and what it does. its alot to learn and you can get overwelmed very easy. it was good though working with other people on the same level and working though it together
