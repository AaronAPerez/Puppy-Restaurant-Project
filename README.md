Making a new Github to clean our collaborated codes for grading.































Reviewer - David Jimenez: <br>
* Index page looks well made over all with most of the elements matching the prototype <br>
* Index page needs footer margin / padding to bottom. <br>
* Index footer needs more spacing horizontally between the two groups of content (eg addres group needs to be spaced more away from the Spaniel Company logo group) <br>
